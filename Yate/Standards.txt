Logging:
	Debug is used for debugging values when still writing the code and very verbose
		ex: _log.Debug("name:" + name);
	Info is used for debugging values or steps that will be helpful in prod when debugging errors.
		do not go overboard on these as the can bloat your logs
		ex: _log.Info("Starting crazy data process loop for category: " + category);
	Warn is used for a recoverable but unexpected issue.
	Error is used for a unexpected issue where you cannot ot choose not to recover
	Fatal is used for when shit hits the fan terrible news or possible world ending events
